# react_directory

## Overview

My first ever React app. The app was built with "npm create-react-app" and then boilerplate files were removed or edited. THe objective was to be able to display a list of people and sort them by a criteria and filter them by a criteria. To meet this object I built a dummy roster of a Discord gaming server my friends and I use. Several separate components were built and rendered and state was used to manage displaying sorted items. The app was styled minimally with the Materialize CSS Framework.
